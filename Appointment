Appointment (very easy)

Enumeration: 

Start with mapping the target machine to see what ports are open

"nmap -T4 -sV <target machine ip>" (-T4 speeds up the scan, -sV probes open ports to find version and service info)

your answer to task 5 should be the output of "VERSION" on the open http port

after you answer all the the "googleable" questions you are left with a task to submit the root flag, like usual. 

Since it's an http port, let's take a look at what's on the site

search in your browser: "http://<targetmachineip" 

We are prompted with a login screen 

Some of the earlier questions ask us about brute-forcing, web-application folder terminology, and gobuster. We can infer that there may be directories we cannot access from this login screen. Let's get to searching.

"dir" is the switch we use to look for directories in gobuster, we can use the command "gobuster dir -u <target machine ip> -w <wordlist> -o <output folder>" 
note: you can find all of the command and flag definitions with -h (help page) 
-u (denotes your target URL), -w (denotes your path to a wordlist you want to use), and -o (is the file location you want to output your results) 

Fill in the appropriate information and search for directories!
