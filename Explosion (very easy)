Explosion (very easy)

Enumeration:

First start with nmap to scan the target machine, we are looking for information related to the remote desktop protocol IP, as the first question asks.

nmap -sV <target machine ip> 
(replace target machine ip with the ip you are given)

We see a number of ports open but we are looking for the remote desktop protocol port number, which is port 3389.

The service running on port 3389 is ms-wbt-server, a Microsoft based service

Task 6 asks a question regarding specification of host's IP address using "xfreerdp" 

We can now look into xfreerdp and find more information

Foothold:

Let's use the command 'xfreerdp -h' (-h for help)

At the top of the documentation we can see:
"Usage: xfreerdp [file] [options] [/v:<server>[:port]]" 

In this instance, server can be replaced with IP, and that is your answer to task 6.

Ignoring the file, options, and port command, we can use "/v: <target machine ip>" to gain more information using xfreerdp. 

Press Y and press enter to trust the certificate

For a domain we can try Explosion, the boxes name. 

Now a password is prompted, if this particular service has been misconfigured we may be able to enter without a password.

Just press enter to try a blank password

This did not work!

When using xfreerdp, if we don't specify a username, it uses our VM username as default.

Lets provide a username this time using /u:Administrator

This immediately prompts us with a password, no domain is asked, let's try no password again. 

We got in! 

Click no, and minimize the Server Manager Dashboard. You should be looking at a remote desktop of the target machine

Open the file that says flag.

You should see the flag! Good work!
